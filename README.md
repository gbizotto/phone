# phone

Study project to learn how to send SMS and listen to its arrival.

## Test:
- Programmatically find out user's phone number. It's a bust, usually it won't work.

## Send and receive SMS
- Sends SMS
- Listens when a new SMS message arrives. As this is just a test project, this happens in two ways:
  - Broadcast receiver listens all the time.
  - Broadcast receiver starts listening only after SMS is sent.
